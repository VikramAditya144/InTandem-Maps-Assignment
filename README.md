# Pin Drop with Remarks

## Overview

Pin Drop with Remarks is a user-friendly web application that allows users to interact with a map interface, drop pins at specific locations, add remarks, and automatically fetch addresses for those locations. This tool is perfect for personal travel planning, location bookmarking, or any scenario where you need to keep track of multiple locations with custom notes.

## Features

- **Interactive Map Interface**: Users can easily navigate and interact with a clear map display.
- **Pin Dropping**: Click anywhere on the map to drop a pin.
- **Custom Remarks**: Add personalized notes to each pin via a popup form.
- **Automatic Address Fetching**: The application automatically retrieves the address for each pin based on its latitude and longitude coordinates using the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API.
- **Saved Pins Sidebar**: All saved pins are displayed in a sidebar list, showing remarks and fetched addresses.
- **Pin Navigation**: Click on any saved pin in the sidebar to center the map on that location and highlight the pin.
- **Local Storage**: Pin data, including remarks and addresses, is saved locally and persists across browser sessions.

## Technology Stack

- React.js
- Leaflet (via react-leaflet) for map functionality
- Framer Motion for animations
- Styled Components for styling
- OpenStreetMap for map tiles
- OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API for geocoding (address fetching)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pin-drop-with-remarks.git
   cd pin-drop-with-remarks
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the API:
   - This project uses the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for geocoding. No API key is required for low-volume usage.
   - In the `utils/api.js` file, ensure the `getAddress` function is properly configured to make requests to the Nominatim API.
   - Be aware of usage limits and consider adding error handling for API requests.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Dropping a Pin**: Click anywhere on the map to drop a new pin.
2. **Adding Remarks**: When a pin is dropped, a popup will appear. Enter your remarks in the input field and click "Save" to add the pin with your notes.
3. **Viewing Saved Pins**: All saved pins appear in the sidebar on the left. Each entry shows the remarks and the fetched address.
4. **Navigating to a Pin**: Click on any pin in the sidebar to center the map on that location and highlight the pin.
5. **Clearing All Pins**: Use the "Clear All Pins" button at the bottom of the sidebar to remove all saved pins.

## API Usage

This project uses the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for reverse geocoding (converting latitude and longitude to addresses). Here are some important points about API usage:

- The API is free to use for non-commercial projects with low query volume.
- There is a usage limit of 1 request per second. Ensure your application respects this limit to avoid being blocked.
- For production use or higher volume applications, consider setting up your own Nominatim instance or using a commercial geocoding service.
- The `getAddress` function in `utils/api.js` handles the API calls. Review and modify this function if you need to change how addresses are fetched.
